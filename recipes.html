       <h2>Vegan Chickpea Curry</h2>
       <p>
      

<strong>INGREDIENTS</strong>:
<br>

2 tablespoons coconut oil <br>
1 onion, chopped <br>
3 cloves garlic, minced <br>
1 tablespoon fresh ginger, grated <br>
1 tablespoon curry powder<br>
1 teaspoon ground cumin<br>
1 teaspoon ground coriander <br>
1/2 teaspoon turmeric <br>
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper (adjust to taste) <br>
1 can (14 oz) diced tomatoes <br>
2 cans (15 oz each) chickpeas, drained and rinsed <br>
1 can (14 oz) coconut milk <br>
1 cup vegetable broth <br>
Salt and pepper to taste <br>
Juice of 1 lemon <br>
Fresh cilantro, chopped, for garnish 
<br>
<strong>Instructions:</strong> <br>

🍀Heat the coconut oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and sauté until translucent, about 5 minutes. <br>

🍀Add the minced garlic and grated ginger to the pot. Sauté for another 1-2 minutes until fragrant. 
<br>

🍀Stir in the curry powder, cumin, coriander, turmeric, and cayenne pepper. Cook for about 1 minute, stirring constantly, to toast the spices.
<br>

🍀Pour in the diced tomatoes, chickpeas, coconut milk, and vegetable broth. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Bring the mixture to a simmer.

🍀Let the curry simmer for 15-20 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together and the sauce to thicken. If the curry gets too thick, you can add more vegetable broth or water.

🍀Just before serving, stir in the lemon juice to brighten up the flavors.
<br>

🍀Serve the vegan chickpea curry over cooked rice or with naan bread. Garnish with chopped fresh cilantro.
